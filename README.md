a small synth i coded in C using the pipewire api as a side project to understand a bit more about audio software c:

im pretty sure it doesn't work on windows since it uses linux events. so far i've only used this on ubuntu 22.04.5 so if
it doesn't work for you i'd recommend using a VM.

it doesn't support playing more than one sound at the same time but that's on my todo list.
